# Lucky-7-Game-Python-
A real life guessing-game implemented into coding in python.

Two dices are thrown and their outcomes are added.The user had to guess the total of their outcome in 3 three different categories which are -
1) Down     : Outcome of both the dice when added was Less than 7.
2) Number 7 : Outcome of both the dice when added was Equal to 7.
3) Up       : Outcome of both the dice when added was More than 7.

If the result is in favour of the chosen category, then the user wins else looses.

The point system is as that user bets points and if he wins, he gains that point and if he looses, he looses the points too.
But if he bets some points the the Number 7 category, he do not just Gains/looses that much point, instead he wins/looses 3 times the points he bet.

In the end when user quits to play, total points are equal to the points of user minus the points of computer.
If the computer points are more than user's points then the user loose the surplus points else he wins the surplus points.

The program uses two random functions to stimulate the 2 dices and game is NOT BIASED at all.

Let the Game Begins!
